# Investigate-a-Dataset
In This project, I analyze a dataset and then communicate my findings findings about it. I made use of Python libraries NumPy, pandas, and Matplotlib for my Analysis. 

I conducted this analysis to find insights and trends that contributed to patients showing up for appointment and to know the instances that influence patient from not showing up for appointment. 

I made use of No-show appointments dataset whose original source is from Kaggle. This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.
Each rows Include

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on what day the patient set up their appointment.

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the location of the hospital.

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates whether or not the patient is enrolled in Brasilian welfare program Bolsa Família.

● The Column 'No-show'indicate ‘No’ if the patient showed up for their appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they did not show up.

# Insights-for-Analysis
● To know if age factor contibutes to patient showing up for appointment or not

● To know if Gender determines or influences the patients from showing up for appointments or not. I also find out if female were more likely to show up or
  male were more likely to show up for appointments.

● I will also find out whether receiving SMS of reminders contributed to patient showing up for appointment or not

● To know if having a particular terminal disease contributed to patients showing up for appointment or not 

# Findings-after-Analysis
After my Analysis, I have been able to find out the following

● Patients within the age of 0-60 responded more to meeting appointment than people within the age of 80-115.

● I been able to find out that both male and female responded most likely to appointment, Female responses is about 79.6% while that of male is 80%.

● Patient who didn't received SMS were most likely to show up for appointment, 83% of the people that did not received SMS showed up for the appointment than
  those that received sms notification.

● Patients with terminal disease like Diabetes showed up for appointment that patients with no terminal disease.

I made use of Python, Juputer Notebook, Pandas and Numpy Libraries, Matplolib and Seaborn Libraries for this Analysis.
